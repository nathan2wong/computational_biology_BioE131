    "# Excerpt of Analysis from Week 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The majority of the microbes identified all can survive in the soil environment, as long as there is some water. Among the bacterium, there are some bacterium, such as cultibacterium and pseudonomasa, that are pathogenic to humans, and have been known to cause infections and illicit immune responses. In addition, there are also fungi present, such as cladosporium, which appear quite regularly in damp environments in the form of mold. Finally, a significant amount of the reads derived from this soil environment were not identified by OneCodex. A deeper investigation is needed to fully understand the range of microbes identified at this particular (radioactive) soil level.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cultibacterium\n",
    "\n",
    "Cultibacterium acnes are aneorbic, Gram-positive bacterium that are commonly linked as the cause of skin acne. Cultibacterium acnes are oppurtunistic pathogens, and are proen to be among the bacteria linked to infections after surgery. Antibiotics are the reponse to these bacterium; however, there has been a rise of antibiotic-resistant C. acnes. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Cladosporium\n",
    "Cladosporium are fungi, which are found in many molds indoors and outdoors, and can thrive on virtually any environment with water and minimal minerals and glucose. While most cladosporium are not pathogenic to humans, a buildup of cladosporium can often lead to musty odors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nocardiodides\n",
    "Nocardiodides are aerobic, Gram-positive bacterium that are most commonly found in soil, herbage, and lakes with high saline concentration. Some nocardiodides, such as WSN05-2, are known to digest toxic pesticides. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Pseudomonas\n",
    "Pseudomonas, as described in previous assignments, are aerobic, Gram-negative bacterium, which are most commonly associated with infections. Pseudomonas are pathogenic to humans, and certain strains are known to be particularly antiobiotic-resistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methylobacterium\n",
    "Methylobacterium are related to alphaproteobacteria, and are Gram-negative bacterium. Methylobacterium are pathogenic to humans, and are known to be resistant to high temperatures and disinfecting agents due to their high rates of homologous recombination, and thus are commonly found in hospitals.\n",
